# :seedling: Selenium

Selenium is a repository with focus in save all the code developed in the course [Automação de Testes com Selenium WebDriver em Java](https://www.udemy.com/course/automacao-de-testes-com-selenium-webdriver-em-java/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), with the instructor Júlio de Lima. This course was my first contact with Test Automation, I already learned and do unit tests with JUnit, but now I learning about the Selenium.

## :fire: Technologies

## :running: Run

To run the project, you need clone the [selenium project](https://github.com/RhianLopes/selenium) and open the project with your IDE, to do this I indicathe the [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/). After open, you the IDE will do the dependencies download by the file `pom.xml`.

Is necessary too do the [chromedriver download](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=81.0.4044.69/) and configure your local path in `Web.class` where you save the your chromedriver.

Finally you can run the automation tests in class `UserInfoPageObjectsTest.class` and explore the project :blush:.

If you have a account in [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) you can put your credentials and run in cloud, but to do this you need to configure the `Web.class` with yours credentials.

And configure in `UserInfoPageObjectsTest.class` to create by BrowserStack.
